# GATK-WGS-Pipeline

A workflow following GATK steps for WGS processing. Alignment from paired-end reads from Illumina Novaseq 6000, to .bam files and generating .vcf files. See contained bash script. It is a good idea to read the updated GATK practices and always take note of tool versions you use.
